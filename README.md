# On RoboterVogel:
RoboterVogel is a general purpose discord bot by me.
It has many features one may need such as moderation commands, music commands, some fun commands, as well as just some other junk.

# On Development:
The bot is still in development and is an on-going project of mine.
Due to it being a single person project, some features I wish to implement will be delayed/not included for the foreseeable future.
Nonetheless, I plan to continue to developing the bot and I appreciate that others as well as myself will continue to use it as long as I can host it.
I also appreciate any suggestions for potential features, as coming up with things people may want and find useful is not my strong suit.

If you wish to reach me, you can shoot me a DM on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ngutyTFPuS) (Raucher Adler#1521), on [Github](https://github.com/RaucherAdler/Der-Roboter-Vogel/) or by [Email](raucheradler@gmail.com), or if you find me anywhere else, that works too.
