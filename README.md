# RoboterVogel:
RoboterVogel is a general purpose discord bot by me.
It has many features one may need such as moderation commands, music commands, and miscellaneous other commands.

## Development:
The bot is still in development and is an on-going project of mine.
Due to it being a single person project, some features I wish to implement will be delayed/not included for the foreseeable future.
Nonetheless, I plan to continue to developing the bot and I appreciate that others as well as myself will continue to use it as long as I can host it.
I also appreciate any suggestions for potential features, as coming up with things people may want and find useful is not my strong suit.

## Usage:
To run your own instance of this bot, ensure you have the required dependencies (Python, FFmpeg, a MongoDB database, and anything listed in requirements.txt), you must have a bot account registered with Discord as well. Provided is a tool (configure.py) which will encrypt your Discord API token and MongoDB URI and store them for retreival when needed by the program. After having done all of the former, you simply run `python main.py`, which will start the bot.
